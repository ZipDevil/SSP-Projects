This repo houses projects for the end of SSP! We'll be diving into how a JavaScript file works with HTML and CSS file to create an interactive web application.

Learning Goals:

- How functions can be used to update the DOM elements (HTML elements) displayed on the browser
- How JavaScript can listen for user interaction events, like clicks, and update the page
- How Javascritp variables can be used to update the HTML seen on the page
- Where we place the <script></script> tag in the HTML document in our index.html file
- Where we place our <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=""> tag in our index.html file

2 - Create a new file on repl.it with a css file, html file, and javascript file. I'd reccomend creating an account on repl.it first, but it's not necessary.
