This repo houses two projects for the end of SSP. We'll be diving into how a JavaScript file works with HTML and CSS file to create an interactive web application.

Learning Goals:

How functions can be used to update the DOM elements (HTML elements) displayed on the browser
How JavaScript can listen for user interaction events, like clicks, and update the page
How Javascritp variables can be used to update the page
